# Privacy Policy for WebSnip Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview

WebSnip is a Chrome extension designed to help users copy web content in a structured format optimized for AI tools. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring complete transparency about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### What We Don't Collect:
- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Browsing history or website visits
- Search queries or typed content
- Copied content or clipboard data
- User behavior analytics
- Device information or IP addresses
- Cookies or tracking data

### What We Don't Store:
- No data is stored locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- No databases or cloud storage is used
- No persistent storage mechanisms are employed

## How WebSnip Works

WebSnip operates entirely within your browser using local processing:

1. **Content Selection**: When you right-click and select "AI用にコピー", the extension analyzes the selected content locally
2. **Local Processing**: All content formatting and CSS selector generation happens on your device
3. **Clipboard Copy**: The formatted content is copied to your local clipboard
4. **No External Communication**: No data leaves your browser or device

## Permissions Used

WebSnip requests minimal permissions necessary for functionality:

- **contextMenus**: To add the right-click menu option
- **scripting**: To analyze selected content on web pages
- **activeTab**: To access content only on the currently active tab

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and do not enable any data collection.

## Third-Party Services

WebSnip does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or external platforms. It operates as a completely self-contained tool.

## Data Security

Since WebSnip does not collect, store, or transmit any data, there are no data security risks associated with using this extension.

## Children's Privacy

WebSnip does not collect any information from users of any age, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our data practices (which is highly unlikely given our no-data-collection approach), we will update this privacy policy and notify users through the Chrome Web Store.

## Open Source Transparency

WebSnip is open source software. You can review our complete source code at:

This transparency allows you to verify that we do exactly what we claim regarding privacy and data handling.
